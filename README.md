# Chat application

Personal chat application project of mine using technoligies as Angular, Socket.IO and JWT.

The two different backend server types (login and the chat server itself) run on Node and connect to a MySQL database but are private on github since I haven't set up the database credentials properly yet (they are written directly into the code).
